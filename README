This directory contains code for generating statistics on the usage of
CC licenses.

== create_tables.sql ==

"mysql -u{rashworld} {xml2sql.py} < create_tables.sql" to initialize
the structures for holding our results.

Note that this should be the only database-dependent part of the
program.  If you want to use postgres or sqlite or Oracle or Microsoft
SQL Server, you should be able to use the rest of the code just fine if
you can adapt this schema definition.

== dbconfig_TEMPLATE.py ==

COPY THIS to dbconfig.py and then customize it to have your database
username, password, host, and database.

== lc_util.py ==

Utilities:

* MSN link counter
* All The Web link counter
* "try_thrice" function for calling code with backoff when exceptions happen :-)

== xml2sql.py ==

This converts the old XML format we used to use for storing statistics
results and imports them into the database.

== simplegoogle.py ==

Trivial wrapper around the Google SOAP API to make querying it a teensy
bit easier for me.

== simpleyahoo.py ==

Same deal as simplegoogle.py, but for Yahoo!'s API.

== link_counts.py ==

Run this to actually generate counts.  At CC, we run it nightly.

Right now, Google is disabled as I get crazy errors from them.
